## 1st iteration
The goal of the first iteration is designing and implementing our DataCapsule file layout.

The following fuse operations should be implemented:
- open
- flush
- read
- write
- setattr
- getattr

Every file will be placed in root directory, and no hierarchy will be assumed.
Record-backend is local file in the first version. 
Make sure every method is abstracted well enough to be replaced by other backends (DataCapsule in the end).

## TODO
- Simple sequential benchmark: open - write large buffer - read - close - open - read - close
- DataCapsule backend support
- Access control design (should bypass default mechanism) and implementation 

### Note on Access Control
We want to use our own access control scheme based on public key. Therfore, "default_permission" option must be disabled. Other fuse-level access control check also should be bypassed. 

### Benchmark Description
The benchmark will measure the time to take each step. 
0. Receive test directory as argument. The file system to which the directory belongs will affect the performance.  
----Test1----(in-memory ops and backup)
1. Open file X.
2. Prepare a buffer of size n MB.
2. Write the buffer to X.
3. Read X.
4. Check correctness.
5. Close X.
----Test2----(read from backend)
1. Open file X.
2. Read X.
3. Check correctness
4. Close X.
----Test3----(overwrite)
1. Open file X.
2. Overwrite some parts + Append.
3. Check correctness
4. Close X.
5. Reopen X
6. Read and check correctness.
