## 1st iteration
The goal of the first iteration is designing and implementing our DataCapsule file layout.

The following fuse operations should be implemented:
- open
- flush
- read
- write
- setattr
- getattr

Every file will be placed in root directory, and no hierarchy will be assumed.
File-backend is memory in the first version. 
Make sure every method is abstracted well enough to be replaced by other backends (DataCapsule in the end).

## TODO
- Simple sequential benchmark: open - write large buffer - read - close - open - read - close
- DataCapsule backend support
- Access control design (should bypass default mechanism) and implementation 

## Note on Access Control
We want to use our own access control scheme based on public key. Therfore, "default_permission" option must be disabled. Other fuse-level access control check also should be bypassed.
